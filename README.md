#Football match prediction
This is a Machine learning model developed for a master's dissertation. If you are using this code in any publications, please cite the references I mentioned below.
To forecast the matches, we implemented six machine learning methods in this study, including Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Neural Network Classifier, and Logistic Regression, XGBoost. Each of the six machine learning models was trained using data from the 2008/2009–2015/2016 English Premier League seasons. The English premier league's 2022–2023 schedule will be predicted using the model that proved to be the most successful following evaluation.
The dataset was derived from Kaggle. It is stored in SQLite format.
